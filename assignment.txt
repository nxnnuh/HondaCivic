 

To understand how to apply styles more precisely, 
review Resource #2: CSS Selectors â€“ Classes and IDs.
Update your HTML files to include:

At least two custom classes used on multiple elements
At least two unique IDs used to style individual sections
In style.css, define custom styles using those class and ID selectors. 
Your styles should demonstrate:

Control over color, layout, or spacing
Purposeful differentiation between sections (e.g., headers vs. footers)
To understand how to structure content on your page, 
Review Resource #3: Structuring Content with Flexbox.
Update at least one page to include:

A container with display: flex and gap styling
Side-by-side content layout (e.g., songs and albums example 
in Resource #3, or two sections within <main>).

Preview in Live Server to ensure that your layout updates 
are working as intended and that all your styles are being implemented.
Save, commit, and push your work to GitHub. Ensure you have
 at least three separate commits from this assignment.
