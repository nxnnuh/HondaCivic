                    <li> Touchscreen Head Unit: Many manufacturers create aftermarket head units to install into the 8th generation civic. This means you can have carplay and bluetooth now built into the car.</li>
                    <li> Backup Camera: Along with the new head unit you can add a fully functioning backup camera.</li>
                    <l1> LED headlights: This allows you to keep up with newer trends of bright lighting and due to the Honda Civic build you can easily replace these yourself.</l1>
